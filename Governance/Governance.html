        <span class="first-letter">I</span>n India, there are very few colleges that offer a supportive environment
        where students can express their concerns and thoughts. But IIT Madras is
        distinct from other universities. The respect accorded to student voices,
        which has been codified in the form of the Students Constitution, is one
        distinct feature of our institute that distinguishes it from other colleges.

              The SLC (Student Legislative Council) is the supreme governing body for 
              students at IIT Madras, functioning under the authority of the Institute Senate. 
              Consisting of around 60 student legislators from diverse hostels and departments, 
              it holds jurisdiction over all student-related matters. Moreover, it offers advisory 
              support to the Institute Senate through the Board of Students.<br>A Speaker is elected by 
              the Student Legislative Council to preside over meetings and supervise its daily operations. 
              The Speaker acts as a bridge between the Student Legislative Council and the Executive Wing. 
              Additionally, nine secretary members are also appointed to contribute to the efficient functioning 
              of the council.

              The Executive Council consists of student representatives who are directly
              elected by the general student body and is the most visible face of the
              Institute's Student Governance process. The executive positions are:
              <ol>

              The Student Ethics and Constitution Commission serves as

              breaches of the Students' Constitution and resolving disputes among
              students, student government officials, and organizations.<br>It is composed
              of three student commissioners and a Faculty Advisor.<br>Additionally, the
              commission is entrusted with the important task of acting as the Student
              Election Commission, overseeing the conduct of elections for more than 170
              student representatives, with an extensive electorate of 9000 voters.

              The core pillars of our institute revolve around its departments, 
              which hold a prominent position in shaping the academic journey of 
              students. Essential events like freshmen orientation and placements 
              are overseen and managed by these departments. To assist with these tasks, 
              each department appoints a team of student representatives in various roles, 
              including:
              <ol>
                  <li>Department Legislators</li>
                  <li>Research Councillors</li>
                  <li>Research Legislators</li>
              </ol>
              <br>
              Furthermore, some 
              departments also have their respective associations, 
              where Department Secretaries are appointed or elected to organize engaging 
              Department Fests. These events and student representatives play a crucial role in 
              fostering a vibrant and enriching academic environment within our institute.

            <div class="tabcontent" id="hostel">
              In each hostel, there are specific requirements 
              and daily operations that students need to manage. 
              To cater to these needs, student representatives are elected to 
              oversee various aspects of dormitory life. These student delegates, 
              along with the Hostel Warden and Assistant Warden, form the Hostel Council. 
              The Hostel Council comprises individuals who represent the students' interests and concerns.
              <ol>
                  <li>Hostel General Secretary</li>
                  <li>Hostel Legislator</li>
                  <li>Sports Secretary</li>
                  <li>Social Secretary</li>
                  <li>Literary Secretary</li>
                  <li>Technical Affairs Secretary</li>
                  <li>Health and Hygiene Secretary</li>
              </ol>
              <br>
              Their collective efforts ensure the smooth functioning 
              and well-being of students within the hostel, as they actively work to address 
              and manage various aspects of hostel life.
